As a fan of Mixed Martial Arts and the UFC in particular, I've been a witness to the challenges that arise in the Pound-For-Pound rankings. Many fans often complain about certain aspects of the Pound-For-Pound rankings and also want better ways to interpret the levels of various fighters. I want to utilize the data from the UFC's history and create an elo system that assigns fighters with their own ranking. I want to prioritize the current state of the fighting world, therefore putting an emphasis on activity/recency of fights. I also want to include different elo ratings for fighters for different contexts (Weight Class, Global, All Time).

This repository should include most of the code for collecting data, interpreting it, and actually assigning fighters with certain elo values.
